# Week10ReturningData

This week expands the menu application to list all projects (name and ID). I wrote code to select a project to edit, involving returning a selected project along with all project details. 
I learned how to:
-write SQL statements to fetch a List of Project records
-perform multiple queries in a single transaction
-write an inner join to fetch category rows related to a project row
-use an Optional to either return a project record or to throw a custom Exception
-writie Lambda expressions both to list the projects and to throw a custom Exception from an Optional.
